Run this command from the repository root and show the founder the result:

```
aios board "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Report the outcome briefly: the conclusion or numbers first, then anything waiting on the founder (approval ids, contradictions, failures). If it prints an approval id, tell him the exact `aios approve <id>` / `aios reject <id>` command. Do not approve anything yourself.
